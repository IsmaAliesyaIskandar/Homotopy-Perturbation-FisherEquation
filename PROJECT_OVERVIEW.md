# Fisher’s Equation using Homotopy Perturbation Method (HPM)

## 📖 Project Overview
This repository contains the Final Year Project (FYP) titled:

**“A Study of the Homotopy Perturbation Method in Solving Fisher’s Equation”**

The project explores how the **Homotopy Perturbation Method (HPM)** can be applied to solve **Fisher’s Equation**, a nonlinear partial differential equation widely used in population dynamics, physics, biology, and ecology.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Apply HPM to solve Fisher’s Equation (FE).
2. Assess the effectiveness and precision of HPM by comparing with exact solutions.
3. Analyze the absolute error for different initial conditions.

## 🧮 Methodology
- Fisher’s Equation (FE) was solved using **Homotopy Perturbation Method (HPM)**.
- Implemented in **Maple Software** with different initial conditions.
- Solutions were compared against exact solutions to calculate **absolute error**.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `docs/` – Contains the full technical report (PDF).
- `src/` – Maple code & scripts used to solve FE using HPM.
- `results/` – Numerical results (tables, figures, graphs).
- `README.md` – Overview of the project.
- `LICENSE` – Open-source license (MIT).

## 📊 Results Summary
- **Case 1**: Tested with λ = 2 and λ = 5. Smaller λ gives smaller absolute error.
- **Case 2**: Tested with x = 2 and x = 5. Smaller x gives smaller absolute error.
- Conclusion: HPM provides accurate approximation, with accuracy depending on initial conditions.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open the Maple code in `src/` (`.mw` or `.txt`).
2. Run the code in Maple to reproduce the results.
3. Refer to `results/` for generated graphs and error analysis.
